# What happens to the diffraction pattern (left) when a mosaic domain (right) splits apart?

![](movie.mov)


Note that at the start of the movie, when the two halves of the mosaic domain
get too far apart to fit on the screen, I am "zoomin out". I am not changing
the unit cell in the calculation!  The diffraction pattern reflects the
un-zoomed image. So, as the two new domains get farther and farther apart, you
eventually see all the interference get averaged over each pixel, and you end
up with a pattern that is exactly twice as intense as the pattern from either
one of the two halves.

Note that the beam is "coherent" throughout this calculation, and yet you only
get interference effects when the two domains are close together. Nevertheless,
the integrated intensity over any given spot is always the same, no matter what
the gap between the mosaic domains is.
