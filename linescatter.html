<h2>or "coherence length" important to diffraction</h2>
<p>
The question of "coherence length" has come up from time to time with regard to large
unit cells of proteins and newer more "coherent" sources.  The coherence length is
often quoted as the dispersion divided by the wavelength squared, but this is the 
longitudinal coherence length, not the one that is important for diffraction!
<p>

Consider Bragg's Law:<p>
<p><a href=Bragg.png><img border=0 src=Bragg-tmb.png></a><p>
Bragg assumed what is called the "far field" approximation in that the detector and the
source are infinitely far away.  This is a fairly good assumption when considering
two atoms bonded together as the distance between them is about ten orders of magnitude
smaller than the distance to the source or detector.  However, for atoms in different
unit cells (particulary unit cells on opposite sides of the crystal) does the
far field approximation still hold?  What if the atoms are on opposite sides of the
room?  Clearly, at some point the distance traveled by a wave front from the source
to the pixel (where the amplitude is actually formed) through one atom vs the other
will start to deviate from what one expects from Bragg's Law.  In fact, a more
general geometric construction is this:<p>
<p><a href=Bragg-ish.png><img border=0 src=Bragg-ish-tmb.png></a><p>
where we are still just considering the difference in path lengths as Bragg did, but
no longer assuming that the distance to the source and detector is infinite.  Remember,
it is not a "photon particle" travling along the arrows above but rather the arrows
represent the distance (and therefore number of oscillations) taken by a wave front
(surface of constant phase) passing through space.  The actual amplitude at the
detector will depend on how all the scattered fronts interfere when they get there.

<p>
This is an example
of the age-old question of when to add amplitudes (Fs) as vectors and then square the 
magnitude of the result to get intensity
or square the F magnitudes first and then add the intensities:<p>
I = (F<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + F<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>) or (F<sub>1</sub> + F<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> ?
<p>
Another form of this same question is: for a perfect crystal containing N atoms,
is the spot intensity proportional to N or N<sup>2</sup>?
<p>The example below addressed both these questions and demonstrates
where the transition between these two modes of scattering takes place.

<h3>general scattering from a line of atoms</h3><p>
To exemplify the "length scale" in a protein crystal where unit cells
no longer interfere 
coherently with each other, I simulated a one-dimensional row of atoms with 
100 Angstrom spacing, 1 Angstrom wavelength radiation and evaluated the first "Bragg peak" 
(or layer line really) located 1 mm from the beam center on a detector surface 
placed 100 mm from the "crystal".<p>

<p>The diagram is not to scale, but one can see how the scattered waves from the
ends of the crystal must travel further than the waves scattered from the middle
of the crystal.  Eventually, they will get out of phase.
<p>  The source is taken to be infinitely far away, 
but the detector was treated in the "near field"
in that distance from each atom to the
 pixel of interest was calculated exactly and the sin<sup>2</sup> and cos<sup>2</sup> added up.
Although the change in the
exact distance to a pixel from atom to atom is small when compared to the average
sample-to-detector distance, it is not small when compared to the wavelength of the
light.<p>


The resulting maximum peak intensity (at the top of the peak) is then:
<p><img src=linescatter.png><p>
Here I have not normalized for the number of atoms (N), but rather just plot the sum 
of the squares of amplitudes from all atoms.  The left hand side is indeed 
proportional to N<sup>2</sup>, but the "wiggling off" at 300-400 atoms 
corresponds to the ends of the line of atoms approaching 1.5-2 microns from 
the origin, which is the point where the atoms at the ends of the "crystal" 
are ~0.5 A further away from the pixel than the atoms at the center.
One might expect that the flattening out of this curve for large numbers 
of atoms would imply that the intensity becomes independent of the number 
of atoms, and indeed it does!  But this intensity is photons/steradian, 
and at the 300-400 atom mark, the Bragg peaks start to become wider 
(due simply to the size of the crystal).  In all cases the integrated 
intensity of the spot is always proportional to N.

The shapes of some selected peaks are:
<p><img src=linescatter_peak_movie.gif><p>
where the legend is the number of atoms in the line and the length of the
"crystal" in microns.  These curves have 
all been normalized to the number of atoms to put them all 
roughly on the same scale: the area under each of these curves is the same.
